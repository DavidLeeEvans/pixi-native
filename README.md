Pixi-native â€” Cross-platform implementation of PIXI.js
=============

The aim of this project is to provide a fast lightweight 2D library that works
across all devices. The Pixi renderer allows everyone to enjoy the power of
hardware acceleration without prior knowledge of WebGL. Also, it's fast. Really fast.

Demos
------------------------

[Bunnymark](https://pixijs.github.io/pixi-native/) is slightly slower than in pixi.js

Workflow
------------------------

1. Prototype with [KotlinJS](http://kotlinlang.org/), using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
2. Perform a cleanup: place types everywhere, make almost everything type-safe
3. Create or use existing generators to get native code for dynamic structures, such as: shader uniforms, SQL tables, game metadata
4. Build it for Android
5. Build it for iOS
